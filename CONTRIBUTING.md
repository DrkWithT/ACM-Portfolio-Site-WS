# Contributing Guidelines

### Workflow
 1. Create your development branch locally and do your coding.
 2. Publish your branch.
 3. Go to the Github repository and open a pull request (PR) for your new changes.
 4. Wait for the owner to comment on it.
    - Recommended: do not merge a PR until all code works properly.

### Issues
 1. Open an issue with a good title and tags.
 2. Be as detailed as you want.

**That's all!**
